### NOTE: if you want a list of plugins go to "awesome-zsh-plugins" and find one that catches your attention!
### ANOTHER NOTE: we use "zi" here as it is a shorthand for "zinit"; kindof like an alias!
### if you're asking "why?" then take a look at this post: https://reddit.invak.id/r/zsh/comments/sqsni7/zshellzi_vs_zdharmacontinuumzinit/
### "zini" should also work; use zi if you care about characters inside code so much like me
